This is a tool for generating test targets for integer tests.

In most cases, you only need to provide the type of the input parameter to generate all possible parameter combinations.

Supports two types of parameters:
Integer range type
Integer enumeration type

Each parameter exists independently and does not affect other parameters.

make doc can make documents, which requires doxygen and graphviz
